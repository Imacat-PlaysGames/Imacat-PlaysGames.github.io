<h1>Welcome to my Little Website</h1>
<p style="font-family: Segoe">
<p>Hello, my name is Imacat/Ellio(I know, usernames are all over the place) and this is my little website hosted on github</br>
<p>Im interested in Computers and electronics, and also have amateur radio licence(im not tell you my call sign for obvious reasons, leaking my identity is not fun).</br>
<p>I dual boot Windows 11 Insider and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Im using windows 11 because I like its file explorer and command prompt but the rest is not really good, I have done some registry to get the right click menu from windows 10 because I hate the windows 11 right click menu with a passion.</br>
<p>I have ADHD, most like Autism to some degree, and suck at spelling.</br>
<p>Im part of the Quantum Science Community on discord, where I am most active.</br>
